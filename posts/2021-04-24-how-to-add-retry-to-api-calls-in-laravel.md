API calls to external endpoints is one of the integral part of web applications, and this come at a cost as they can fail at any point of the transmission. the failiure be caused by downtime in the receiveng server end, invalid client request or even the most popular one when sending data to public API which is exceeding rate limit or just some random errors, at any point these failures occur during API communication, being aware or handling this errors is not enough, a more proactive action might just be to retry the request.

In this article we would look at how to add retries to API request in PHP using the Exponential Back-off Algorithm, that can be used to progressively increase the time between each retries:

**Retry Algorithm**

```md
1. make request to endpoint
2. if request succeds, continue
3. if request fails and total_attempts is greater or equal to maximum_retry, continue
4. else increase total_attempts by 1
5. wait for  maximum_retry * total_attempts
6. goto step 1
```

### **Exponentail Back-off in action**
Though for the purpose of this article we will implement the Exponential Back-off retry in PHP, this algorithm can be implemented in any language.

First let's look at a simple **doRequest()** function that sends POST request to an endpoint:

```php
public function doRequest(string $url, array $options): Array
{
    try {
        $res = $this->client->post($url, $options);
        return json_decode($res->getBody());
    } catch (\Exception $e) {
        Log::info("Fail because of ".$e->getMessage()
        return [];
    }
}
```

Given that our request is likely to fail for variety of reasons, we want to retry the request before giving up:
```php
public function doRequest($url, $options): Array
{
    $backOff = false;
    $backOffLimit = 20;
    $backOffRetry = 0;

    do {
        try {
            $backOff = false;
            $res = $this->client->po($url, $options);
            return json_decode($res->getBody());
        } catch (\Exception $e) {
            if ($backOffRetry >= $backOffLimit) {
                Log::info("Fail because of ".$e->getMessage()." after $backOffLimit");
                return [];
            }
            $backOff = true;
            $backOffRetry++;
            sleep($backOffRetry * 2);
        }
    } while ($backOff);
}

```
The implementation can be improved further to allow the **doRequest()** function caller to have more control over maximum retries and for what status code to retry, as the current implementation retires the request irrespective of the response status code:

```php

public function doRequest($url, $options, $maxRetry = 5, $statusToRetry = [500, 503] ): Array
{
    $backOff = false;
    $backOffLimit = $maxRetry;
    $backOffRetry = 0;

    do {
        try {
            $backOff = false;
            $res = $this->client->post($url, $options);
            return json_decode($res->getBody());
        } catch (\Exception $e) {
            $isRetryableStatus = in_array($e->status, $statusToRetry);
            if ($backOffRetry >= $backOffLimit || !$isRetryableStatus) {
                Log::info("Fail because of ".$e->getMessage()." after $backOffLimit");
                return [];
            }
            $backOff = true;
            $backOffRetry++;
            sleep($backOffRetry * 2);
        }
    } while ($backOff);
}
```
**Key Takeaways**  
- The do while loop allows us to try the request at least once, this could have also been a recursive function.
- The implemenation described in this article can be applied to any http request library if it doesnt have the retry functionality or if you decide to handle the retruy your own way.
